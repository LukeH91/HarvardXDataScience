## Advanced Dplyr

# previously, we constructed a frame stratified by HR like this
dat <- Teams %>% filter(yearID %in% 1961:2001) %>%
  mutate(HR = round(HR/G, 1), 
         BB = BB/G,
         R = R/G) %>%
  select(HR, BB, R) %>%
  filter(HR >= 0.4 & HR<=1.2)

# then, because we didn't know the LM function, we compared the regression lines
# in each strata separately
dat %>%  
  group_by(HR) %>%
  summarize(slope = cor(BB,R)*sd(R)/sd(BB))

# we want the confidence intervals for each estimated slope
# however, lm does not work with grouped tibbles - it is not from tidyverse
dat %>%  
  group_by(HR) %>%
  lm(R ~ BB, data = .) %>%
  .$coef

# include the lm inside a summarize and it will work
dat %>%  
  group_by(HR) %>%
  summarize(slope = lm(R ~ BB)$coef[2])

# the broom package lets us connect lm to the tidyverse
# tidy function from broom returns estimates in and information in a data frame
library(broom)
fit <- lm(R ~ BB, data = dat)
tidy(fit)

# add confidence intervals
tidy(fit, conf.int = TRUE)

# combine with group_by and summarize to get the table we want
dat %>%  
  group_by(HR) %>%
  summarize(tidy(lm(R ~ BB), conf.int = TRUE))

# it's a data frame so we can filter and select the rows and columns we want
dat %>%  
  group_by(HR) %>%
  summarize(tidy(lm(R ~ BB), conf.int = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(term == "BB") %>%
  select(HR, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)

# this table can be visualised with ggplot
dat %>%  
  group_by(HR) %>%
  summarize(tidy(lm(R ~ BB), conf.int = TRUE)) %>%
  filter(term == "BB") %>%
  select(HR, estimate, conf.low, conf.high) %>%
  ggplot(aes(HR, y = estimate, ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) +
  geom_errorbar() +
  geom_point()

# so we are back to asking if the slopes change between strata - the confidence
# intervals to not overlap, so our assumption that the slopes are the same
# is a sound one. 

## Assessment

set.seed(1, sample.kind = "Rounding") # if you are using R 3.6 or later

# Group by pair and summarize the number of observations in each group.
galton %>% group_by(pair) %>% summarize(n = n())

galton %>%
  group_by(pair) %>%
  summarize(cor = cor(parentHeight, childHeight))

# Use lm() and the broom package to fit regression lines for each parent-child 
# pair type. Compute the least squares estimates, standard errors, confidence 
# intervals and p-values for the parentHeight coefficient for each pair.
# What is the estimate of the father-daughter coefficient?
galton %>%

# For every 1-inch increase in mother's height, how many inches does the typical son's height increase?
galton %>%
  group_by(pair) %>%
  do(tidy(lm(childHeight ~ parentHeight, data = .), conf.int = TRUE)) %>%
